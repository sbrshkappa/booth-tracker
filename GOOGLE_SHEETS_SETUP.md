# Google Sheets Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up automatic writing of user completion data to Google Sheets when users complete all booths.

## üéØ Overview

When a user completes visiting all booths, their data will automatically be written to a Google Sheet with the following information:
- User details (email, name, badge number)
- Registration and completion dates
- Progress statistics
- Complete visit history

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Google Account** - You need a Google account to create Google Sheets and Apps Script
2. **Supabase Project** - Your booth tracker backend should be set up
3. **Google Sheet** - A spreadsheet to store the completion data

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Google Sheet

1. Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Rename the first sheet to "User Completions"
4. Copy the **Sheet ID** from the URL:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE/edit
   ```

### Step 2: Create Google Apps Script

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `google-apps-script/Code.gs`
4. Update the `SHEET_ID` constant with your actual Google Sheet ID
5. Save the project with a name like "Booth Tracker Webhook"

### Step 3: Deploy Google Apps Script

1. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment"
2. Choose "Web app" as the type
3. Set "Execute as" to "Me"
4. Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the **Web app URL** (you'll need this for Supabase)

### Step 4: Get Webhook URL

1. In your Google Apps Script, run the `getWebhookUrl()` function
2. Copy the URL from the console output
3. This is your webhook URL for Supabase

### Step 5: Deploy Supabase Edge Function

1. Navigate to your Supabase project directory:
   ```bash
   cd api/supabase
   ```

2. Deploy the new Edge Function:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy writeToGoogleSheet
   ```

3. Set the environment variable in Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK_URL="YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
   ```

### Step 6: Test the Integration

1. **Test Google Apps Script**:
   - Run the `setupSheet()` function to set up headers
   - Run the `testWriteToSheet()` function to test data writing

2. **Test Complete Flow**:
   - Register a new user in your app
   - Complete all booths
   - Check if data appears in your Google Sheet

## üìä Google Sheet Structure

The Google Sheet will have these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | When the completion was recorded |
| Email | User's email address |
| First Name | User's first name |
| Last Name | User's last name |
| Badge Number | User's badge number |
| Registration Date | When user registered |
| Completion Date | When user completed all booths |
| Booths Visited | Number of booths visited |
| Total Booths | Total number of booths |
| Completion Percentage | Percentage completed (100%) |
| Visit History | JSON string with detailed visit history |

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your Supabase project:
- `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK_URL` - Your Google Apps Script webhook URL

### Frontend Environment Variables

For Vercel deployment, add these to your environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Sheet not found" error**:
   - Make sure the sheet name is exactly "User Completions"
   - Check that the Sheet ID is correct

2. **"Webhook URL not configured" error**:
   - Verify the `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable is set
   - Check that the webhook URL is accessible

3. **"User not found" error**:
   - Verify the user email is correct
   - Check that the user exists in your database

4. **"Failed to write to Google Sheets" error**:
   - Check Google Apps Script logs for errors
   - Verify the Apps Script has proper permissions

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Supabase Logs**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs writeToGoogleSheet
   ```

2. **Check Google Apps Script Logs**:
   - Open your Apps Script project
   - Go to "Executions" tab
   - Check for any error messages

3. **Test Webhook Manually**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"test": "data"}'
   ```

## üîÑ Manual Refresh

If you want to manually refresh the Google Sheet data:

1. **For all users**: Create a new Apps Script function to fetch all completed users from Supabase
2. **For specific user**: Use the existing webhook with a specific user email

## üìà Analytics

Once set up, you can use the Google Sheet data for:
- **Raffle management** - Export emails of completed users
- **Analytics** - Track completion rates and timing
- **Reporting** - Generate reports for stakeholders
- **Data analysis** - Analyze user behavior patterns

## üîí Security Considerations

- The Google Apps Script webhook is publicly accessible
- Consider adding authentication if needed
- The webhook only writes data, it doesn't read sensitive information
- User data is only written when they complete all booths

## üéâ Success!

Once everything is set up, every time a user completes all booths, their data will automatically appear in your Google Sheet, ready for raffle management and analytics!
